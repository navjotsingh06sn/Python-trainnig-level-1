# Collaboration:- It is a process where two or more people work together to achieve a common goal
# another can't add the code in your repository without your permission.
# You can give permission to another person to add the code in your repository by adding them as a collaborator in your repository.


# IMPORTANT
# git rm --cached Bachend/.env
# echo "Backend/.env" >> .gitignore
# touch .gitignore
# node_modules = It is very large and can recreate it by running npm install command. So, we don't need to upload it in git hub. So, we can add it in
# Backend/.env = It is used to store environment variables. So, we don't need to upload it in git hub
# .env = It is also used to store environment variables
# .DS_Store = It is a hidden file that is created by macOS to store custom attributes of a folder. So, we don't need to upload it in git hub
